# Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a client looking to expand the reach of their current game Draw It or Lose It. Right now their game is only avaiable in an Andriod app.
  They are wanting my consulting company to create a web-based game that will serve multiple different platforms for this game of theirs. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I believe I did a nice job in the Executive Summary, capturing all the important points while keeping it consice. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The most helpful step in the design document for developing the code was defining the design requirements. I helped show me what they are asking for 
  specifically and what I needed to include in the program.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  There are a couple sections of the design document that I would like to revise. The number one section in need of revision would be the System Archetecture
  View. This section was not required to be filled in for the assignment. However, if I was to go back I would revise it by filling in this section and it would 
  help me gain a better understanding of that area. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The user's needs are the client's way of describing what they want the end product application to do. These are important to include and consider for without 
  them you would not know what the client is expecting you to build. In the design document, the user's needs are included under the Design Requirements in the
  Executive Summary. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  This assignment practiced the use of pre-made patterns. For future software development, I would take these lessons and look for these fimiliar patterns in 
  my code and simplify my program by detirmining which of these patterns best fits my code in particular places.
